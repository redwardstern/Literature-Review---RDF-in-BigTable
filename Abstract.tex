The financial knowledge base a triple store is built on Google BigTable using Spark as a querying language.

The primary problem is relating elements of differing statements to each other and inferring an overall hierarchy.

Additionally, there may be incorrect elements.

Finally there may be new elements that need to be fitted to the hierarchy.

After the KB is built, then we will associate the stock values for each traded stock for two weeks prior and two weeks posterior to the financial statements.
